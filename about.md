I write code and make maps for conservation. I get excited about remote sensing and GIS, reproducible research, data visualization, and building tools to facilitate conservation decision-making.

I'm currently working at the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](http://www.birds.cornell.edu/) facilitating the use of [eBird](http://ebird.org/content/ebird/) data for conservation management, planning, and policy-making. Prior to this, I completed a master's with [Jedediah Brodie](http://jedediahbrodie.weebly.com/) in the [Zoology Department](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. My research focused on the effects of human-induced land use change on ecosystems and how systematic conservation prioritization can be used as a tool to mitigate these negative impacts. In a previous life, I studied physics at the undergraduate and graduate levels, which I credit with shaping how I think and approach problems.
